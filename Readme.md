# ⚖️ Lawyer Schedule 2025  
### Full-Stack Appointment & Availability Management System

A production-oriented full-stack web application designed to manage **appointments, availability, time-off, and client bookings** for law firms.

This project focuses on **real-world business logic**, secure authentication, role-based access, and scalable architecture — not just UI demos.

---

## 🎯 Project Purpose

Law firms often rely on manual processes such as phone calls, emails, and spreadsheets to manage appointments.

**Lawyer Schedule 2025** replaces this workflow with a centralized system that allows lawyers to:

- define their availability once
- share a booking link with clients
- manage time-off and exceptions
- reduce scheduling conflicts and back-and-forth communication

The project was built to simulate **production-level requirements**, making it suitable as both a foundation for real use and a strong portfolio project.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The application follows a clear client–server architecture:
- The frontend handles UI, state management, and user interactions.
- The backend exposes a REST API responsible for authentication, scheduling logic, validation, and persistence.
- Business logic (appointments, availability, time-off) is centralized on the server to ensure consistency and security.
- Background jobs are used for reminders and scheduled tasks.

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- JWT-based authentication using HTTP-only cookies
- Role-based authorization enforced at middleware level
- CORS allowlists for trusted client origins
- Rate limiting and security headers enabled via middleware

---

## ▶️ Running Locally

```bash
cd server && npm install && npm run dev
cd client && npm install && npm run dev
```
